Elita
-----

Elita is a framework for continuous deployment (aka continuous delivery) and API-driven infrastructure.

It can be thought of as
middleware between a continuous integration server (such as Jenkins, Teamcity or Bamboo) and the infrastructure that
actually runs the code (production and QA/staging servers, supporting machines, etc.). Elita allows programmatic code
deployment, build (re-)packaging, server provisioning and more.

It uses `salt <http://www.saltstack
.org>`_ remote execution and a plugin architecture to allow custom actions and hook routines.
