FOR VAGRANT TESTING:

- Put your (testing!) Bitbucket credentials in this directory using the following naming convention:

"bb_username.txt" - Bitbucket username in plain text format (no newlines: $ echo -n "username" > bb_username.txt)
"bb_password.txt" - Password for above account (no newlines)
"private.key" - SSH private key with permissions to push to repositories under the above BitBucket account
"public.key" - SSH public key corresponding to private key above

The setup_data.sh script (run as the last part of Vagrant provisioning) will use these credentials to automatically
create the Elita objects (keypair, gitprovider, server, application) so you don't have to do this manually after each
vagrant up.
